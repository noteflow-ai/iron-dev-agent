Please follow these principles to create a professional, comprehensive, and detailed product requirements document:

1. Document Structure and Format
   - Use clear hierarchical structure and standard Markdown format
   - Use numbering system to maintain organization (1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, etc.)
   - Use tables, lists, and quotes to enhance readability
   - Include a table of contents for easy navigation

2. Content Quality Requirements
   - All requirements must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART)
   - Use precise business terminology, avoid ambiguous expressions
   - Provide data-supported analysis and decision rationale
   - Include user stories and scenario descriptions to provide context

3. Requirement Prioritization
   - Use clear priority classification (e.g., P0-P4 or MoSCoW method)
   - Explain the basis for each priority determination
   - Ensure critical path functionality is emphasized

4. Visual Aids
   - Add flowcharts to explain user journeys and system processes
   - Use wireframes or diagrams to show interface layouts
   - Provide state transition diagrams to explain complex interactions

5. Technical Considerations
   - Include non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Consider technical limitations and dependencies
   - Provide API design suggestions or data models

Please retain reasonable parts of the original document and only modify content that needs updating. Ensure the final document is professional, comprehensive, and actionable.

Please create an interactive static HTML prototype, not React TypeScript code. Follow these principles:

## Design Principles
1. Clean and clear visual design that highlights important content
2. Responsive layout that adapts to different devices
3. User experience that follows industry best practices
4. Appropriate color scheme and typography
5. Clear visual hierarchy and navigation structure

## Technical Requirements
1. Use pure HTML, CSS, and simple JavaScript
2. Use Bootstrap 5 framework to ensure responsive design and professional appearance
3. Ensure code is concise, efficient, and easy to understand
4. Use relative units (rem, em, %) rather than absolute units (px)
5. Mobile-first responsive design

## Interactive Features
1. Ensure all buttons and links have clear interaction feedback (hover effects, click states)
2. Add simple click event handlers for buttons (using alert or console.log to simulate actual functionality)
3. Links should use appropriate href attributes (using "#" or "javascript:void(0)" as placeholders)
4. Forms should have basic validation functionality (required field checks, format validation)
5. Add appropriate hover effects and state changes (:hover, :active, :focus)
6. Implement simple tabs, accordion panels, and other interactive components

## Visual Design
1. Use a consistent color scheme (primary, secondary, accent colors)
2. Apply appropriate whitespace to enhance readability
3. Clear text hierarchy (headings, subheadings, body text, captions)
4. Use high-quality icon and image resources
5. Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

## Required Elements
1. Responsive navigation bar (collapsing to hamburger menu on mobile devices)
2. Prominent headline and call-to-action (CTA) buttons
3. At least one form component (with validation functionality)
4. At least one interactive component (tabs, accordion, carousel, etc.)
5. Footer area (with copyright information, links, etc.)
